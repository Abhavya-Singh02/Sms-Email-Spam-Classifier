# üìß Email/SMS Spam Classifier üö´

This project presents a machine learning-based solution to classify email and SMS messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam**. The model analyses text content to predict whether a message is potentially harmful or safe.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Text Preprocessing**  
  - Lowercasing  
  - Tokenisation  
  - Removal of stopwords and punctuation  
  - Stemming using Porter Stemmer  

- **Vectorisation Approach**  
  Initially, the model was developed using the **Bag of Words (BoW)** technique. However, during the evaluation phase, the **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** method was applied, which significantly improved the model‚Äôs performance.

- **Normalisation Attempt**  
  The impact of **MinMax Normalisation** was also tested. However, rather than improving the model‚Äôs effectiveness, it slightly reduced the overall accuracy, demonstrating that in this particular text classification problem, normalisation did not contribute positively.

- **Model Exploration**  
  A wide range of models were trained and evaluated, including:  

  - **Logistic Regression**  
  - **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**  
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**  
  - **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)**  
  - **Random Forest Classifier**  
  - **AdaBoost Classifier**  
  - **Bagging Classifier**  
  - **Extra Trees Classifier**  
  - **Gradient Boosting Classifier**  
  - **XGBoost Classifier**  
  - **Voting Classifier**  
  - **Stacking Classifier**  

## üèÜ Best Model

After thorough experimentation, the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier emerged as the best-performing model in terms of accuracy, precision and generalisation capability, particularly well-suited for this text classification task.

## üöÄ Deployment

The model has been deployed using **Streamlit**, offering a simple and interactive web interface:
